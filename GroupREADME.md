# HOW TO USE

- I have set up local, dev, and prod. Use docker-compose.local.yml to compose and start developing.
- Once we have established our API and you have your own API key you can just add it to an .env file on your local machine.
- You can use the run-compose-local.sh script to start running the app. We current only have one app in the project (accounts).
